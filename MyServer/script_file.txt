I wrote two scripts in Python and Bash to make it simpler to run my server. 

For the first time, simply run the Makefile which should build the .class Java
binaries. 

All requested types, HTML, TXT, JPG, GIF should be supported. The homepage of
SCU contains all of them. 

Once `Makefile` is run, run the server with below example command:
/server -document_root "<absolute_path>/webserver_files" -port 8080

I also included a bunch of screenshots in the screenshot folder.
